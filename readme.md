# Rhythm
## [Get Rhythm, if you get the blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0shYecWAc) from webtypography

Rhythm will be a SASS plugin to make maintaining a baseline on your web pages more easy, much like [Vertical Rhythm in Compass](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/). My goal is to make it more transparent.

I am still studying on the subject right now, but already created this repo to call dibs on the name ;)
